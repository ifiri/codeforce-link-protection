== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it just another page content plugin? =

Yes, and no. This plugin lies between two edges - small plugins for little specific tasks and big frameworks.

= Is this plugin compatible with custom post types? =

Yes, it is.

= Is this plugin compatible with my theme? =

Yes. But every theme have unique css, and appearance of widget \ shortcode will be depend on theme styles.

= I don't have link to full post. How I can add it? =

Links to full entry appears automatically - this feature depends of theme settings and Wordpress core. If you have more-tag in post content, or if content length long enough, "read more" link will be available. We don't override this behavior. Use native wordpress hooks for change it.

== Documentation ==

= Shortcodes =
There is just one shortcode `tea_page_content`. Below there is an example with basic parameters.
`[tea_page_content template="default" order="asc" posts="12,45,23"]`
You also can used template variables (see Templates section at documentation) and options.

= Parameters =
There is some built-in options. Let's take a closer look:

* **order** allows you set entries order. All posts and pages will be sorted by date, and you can choose a direction - by ascending or by descending. Sorting by descending is a default behaviour.
* **template** allows you choose layout which will look as you want. In shortcode just type full name of your template without extension, for example `default` or `your-template-name`.
* **show_page_thumbnail** allows you enable or disable displaying thumbnail of entry. If you don't want see page thumbnail, type `show_page_thumbnail="false"`. Default - *true*.
* **show_page_content** allows you enable or disable displaying content of entry. Default - *true*.
* **show_page_title** allows you enable or disable displaying title of entry. Default - *true*.
* **linked_page_title** allows you enable or disable linking title of entry. In other words, title will be link to full article. Default - *false*.
* **linked_page_thumbnail** allows you enable or disable linking thumbnail of entry. In other words, thumbnail will be link to full article. Default - *false*.

= Creating simplest custom template =
By default plugin will be search custom templates in a folder named `templates` in your theme. For create the one just add into this directory a new file with name like `tpc-{template-name}.php`. Every template **should** be named by that mask! Then put in created file your code. For example:
`
<?php foreach ($entries as $entry) : ?>
	<div class="entry">
		<h3>
			<?php echo $entry['title'] ?>
		</h3>
		
		<div class="post-content">
			<?php echo $entry['content'] ?>
		</div>
	</div>
<?php endforeach; ?>
`
For using your templates in shortcode, you need just choose it in widget or pass full filename (but without extension) in shortcode. For example:
`template="tpc-my-template"`

= Parameters in template =
Above you can see very simple example of custom template with `title` and `content` parameters. But this is not all - there is a full list of allowed parameters which you can use.

* **$count** - Count of all passed entries
* **$instance** - Array with user defined and default parameters. There is all list of options from self-titled section above.
* **$template_variables** - Array with template-level variables.
* **$caller** - Special flag that determine a module that called template: from widget or from shortcode. Can be `widget` or `shortcode`.
* **$entries** - List of posts, pages, etc.
	* **title** - Title of current entry
	* **content** - Content of current entry. When page have more tag, will be used `the_content` function, in other cases will be used `the_excerpt`
	* **thumbnail** - Thumbnail of entry (if exists)
	* **link** - Link of entry
